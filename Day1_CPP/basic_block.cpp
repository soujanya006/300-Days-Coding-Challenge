    //int main() declares a function named main that returns an integer (int). In both C and C++, main must return int.
    // The curly braces {} enclose the body of the main function. Any code you want to run in your program should be placed inside these braces.



    // Since this is just an empty main function, it doesn't perform any action.

    return 0; // This line returns the integer 0, which typically indicates successful completion of the program.
}// return 0; at the end of main signifies that the program has completed successfully. In some environments, returning a non-zero value may indicate an error or abnormal termination.
